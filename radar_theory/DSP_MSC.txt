 Mention the Hilbert transform and how the I and Q data is acquired. Lit review and or design chapters
range profiles
frame of range profiles
waterfall
bin straddle loss (may have added already)
L3 slide 15 shows magnitude detectors
electronic scanning PESA
resource management - scheduler

phase always there. even in triangle wave. Must attempt using phase in the triangle modulation on each sweep. 
Maybe check phase change between up and down? Or phase change with respect to tx/reference signal?

Mention modifying program on Pi for experimentation
	- different waveform parameters

Should we try reducing the bandwidth? 
	- benefits of doing this?

Calculate TBWP - necessary?
 		- maybe simulation of Top Hat fn

WINDOWING
	- reduces maximum detection range!!! = LOSS
	- ML width incr. = reduced resolution
	- use table in report to justify

DETECTION
	- add info on detection 
	- Rayleigh etc to show PFa
	- shows AMPLITUDE distribution sqrt(i2 + q2)
	- for linear tracks, can set false alarm rate higher => classification because of this. cognitive

FIR FILTER DELAY
	-	only uses past values?
	- needs to wait for whole sweep to be received, then apply weighting and sum?
	- add filter diagram to report to show why there is a delay
	- add to lit review?
	- also slower since its done on the radar embedded system!
	- taps = delays! essentially means the whole wave must be received, i think

Uses the term filter to refer to any operation on a signal!
	- cfar could be like a filter?
	- beat window is like a filter

Note that urad may have both FIR and IIR. FIR has only prev inputs so quicker to process?
Mention both using the diagram from the textbook

CONVOLUTION
	- flip/time reverse signal because first sample must be fed in first!
	- therefore value at index 0 gets convolved first etc

sin and cos are harmonic sigs

down side of oversampling - increased processing time!


improving doppler resolution needs
	1) longer chirp - more NB
	2) higher sampling rate possibly

Cant make ramp to short as the slope will be too high for the hardware!

FMICW - interrupted CW


Can use CW assuming that only one car will have sufficient positive doppler
FMCW for range only

mention how radar orientation kept upright to reduce ground bounce as seen
in uRAD beam pattern

DELAY LINE CANCELLER
	- add to report and mention why it was not used (coherence etc)

show how clutter reduced with DLC or how in our system with a fixed min doppler 
value. 

Mention that slow moving targets will not be detected due to this - as they will
encroach on the clutter doppler zone   

MY system is MTD!!!!! filters out bins where clutter doppler
-	now thinking that for the new system, the fd min may or may not be necess
	- still think it is incase clutter breaches threshold
