Data follows the following format:
Target number	Distance (m)	Velocity (m/s)	SNR (dB)

The file names correspond to the uRAD USB v1.2 and uRAD RPi v1.1 device measurements. Note that uRAD USB runs SDK 1.1 whereas uRAD RPi runs SDK v1.0.
Facing the device from the RPi power port, the uRAD USB is the left-hand side radar and the uRAD RPi is the right-hand side radar.
The program currently overwrites the last record session. If you would like to permanently save data, rename the file and/or copy to a different directory.
