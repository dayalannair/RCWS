Notes from last meeting
- Conclusions address the objectives  
- Keagan conclusion  
- link windowing, CFAR, etc to radar

### To Do
1. Finish up simulation section and send for review
	1. Need to decide on where to put results - seems better to have it in simulation section, since the results are not technically results, and it is more cohesive to state what was found after describing the process. Also, results are instant, whereas normal design requires field testing
	2. Need to get simulation outputs into Excel for tabulation and comparison to expected values
		1. Need to calculate conversion for range as well as speed
	3. Maybe another plot? - probably not necessary
		1. Multi car one lane
		2. One each lane crossing
2. Address Yunus' comments, whats left of them (and Simon's)
3. Finish reviewing the design and implementation sections
4. Field test/data collection
	1. Need to set up the Python lines in Terminus
	2. Need to get raw and processed data
	3. Just record the TOA and if it is accurate, assume the warning will be passed accordingly
5. Sort out results section 
	1. Add final results
	2. Any intermediate results to be added?
		1. Could add more single radar results
		2. Could add results without angle correction - may be a waste
6. Read through Keagan's results and conclusion
7. Conference paper
	1. Get resources
	2. start
