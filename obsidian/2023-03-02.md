Blurb was written on the simulation data tables added yesterday. Likely needs refinement

### To do:
1.  Finish up simulation section and send for review
2. Address remaining comments by Yunus and Simon
3. Get final set of uncontrolled road data
	1. Remember to take laptop - or use a USB. Easier to SSH transfer files from PI -> Laptop -> USB -> Desktop
	2. Get data when placing radar on boot
		1. Ensure not a windy or hot day - autumn is coming
4. Finish reviewing design and implementation sections
5. Add final results to the results section
	1. Determine if more controlled measurements are required + GPS
