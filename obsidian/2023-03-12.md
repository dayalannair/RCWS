- [ ] Add that normalising FFT input is just an amplitude offset so it was not implemented
- [ ] Ensure that detection in furthest range bin SNR is limiting and CFAR detection (MATLAB) is not able to detect. Show calcs of max expected speed and how much time available for acceleration
- [ ] Finish paper review of Design chapter
- [ ] Start on comments on other chapters
- [ ] Implement any MATLAB changes in Python and check/plot results and data
