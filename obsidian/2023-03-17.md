### Findings
- 1024 point fft is good. Check new bin width and scan width using calcs and view in matlab
- Test GOCA CFAR some more

### To do

- [ ] submit Implementation for review
	- [ ] May need to include FFT discussion - rather put this in results where it is now
	- [ ] GOCA CFAR for results also
- [ ] Prep results for final measurents
	- [ ] Controlled raw data + timestamp collection
	- [ ] Uncontrolled proc only data collection + add timeStamps
- [ ] Finish off comments on CH4 and CH2
