- [x] Separate test rig design and test rig implementation
- [x]  Add beat and doppler frequency for triangle FMCW to lit Review
- [x]  Simulate using Swerling 1 or 2 for car target (PAST)
- [ ]  Solve ADT measurement vs. actual diff
- [ ]  Angle correction
	1. code
	2. testing (controlled)
- [ ]  Check speed measurements of rt data and iq proc
- [ ] Add decellerating target for phased isotropic sim to report and discuss
- [ ] Add interfering target fig and explain how as radial R becomes closer, tracks form incorrectly - proc can be tricked in busy scenarios - beamforming should avoid this
