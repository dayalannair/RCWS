Need to address last few comments by Simon on the simulation section
Need to solve why there is difference in ADT range measurement
Need to reduce angle adjustment of LHS radar - do some calcs, seems like 15 degrees may be better
	- check actual measurements for 25 degrees (tentative)

Need to set up controlled tests, preferably outside peralex
Need to finish up results section 
	- results depend on final tests which depend on angle adjustment and data observation
	- may be easier to get other sections out before results
