Adding printed changes to simulation section
Need to add frame sync rtproc and iq_data versions - not strictly, would be nice
One more controlled test
	- UCT
	- Somewhere else
Add new tables to the simulation section (cross over) and continue cleaning

Angle correction wrong in matlab - need to check that angle corrected values are larger than measurement

RT proc not looking good. Present offline proc results using new heatmap scheme
	- #### NB not looking good for raised tests

Video frame rate higher/faster in rt proc than iq. Likely 4thd vs 2thd. Use 2 thd iq data collection next time. 
	- Makes sense since video in same thd as radar? should be the other way round?
	- 
	Add option to record offline proc and store in data repo. Then dont need to reproc each time
