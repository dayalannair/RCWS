- [ ] Add FFT length vs. accuracy scatters and table to results
- [ ] Update calibration section in impl - maybe remove section and add to another, since fairly straight fwd. 
- [ ] Get impl section reviewed
- [ ] Finish lit review comments - not pressing since they seem like QOL improvs
- [ ] Simons comments on simulation and method (see canvas)


If possible, get patch ant sim working. Else, phrase it better/dont give it a section in the sim section, maybe just add the antenna pattern plots.

# Important
1. Accuracy only important for controlled tests
2. Need GPS for controlled tests
3. Dependance on range accuracy more influential as range reduced. Opposite for velocity
